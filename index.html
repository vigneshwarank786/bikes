                              <p class="lead">When you drive a car, you are covered from all the sides. You do have a window, but many people don’t pull is down because of the AC in the car. However, when you are riding a motorcycle, you can interact directly with the environment. You can smell, sight, sound, the thrill, and the touch of the environment. When you ride a motorcycle, you automatically connect with the environment.</p>
                          <h3 class="text-success">It Enhances Your Reflexes</h3>
                              <p class="lead">You need to work with your whole body to balance a motorcycle.

                              <p class="lead">This is not a hoax; it is scientifically proven that riding a motorcycle enhances cerebral power. There was a study conducted between the riders that regularly ride bikes to work and those who did not. It was found in the studies that the brain of the rider who rides a bike regularly was more stimulated then the other rider while motorcycle riding. It was also proven that memory and spatial reasoning capacity of these riders were also dramatically increased. </p>
